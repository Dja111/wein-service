# wein-service

This service is based on the microservice architectur.

Ps: This Branch shows an alternativ CI without the using of the [wein-service-env](https://github.com/Dja111/wein-service-env) repository.

## Description

The wein-service provides RESTful CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing wein models. This service adheres strictly to REST principles, ensuring simplicity and compatibility.

## Purpose 

This project serves as an application that can be deployed on Kubernetes clusters (e.g., Minikube, EKS) using a CI/CD pipeline powered by ArgoCD. To keep things lightweight and efficient, data is stored using an H2 in-memory database during development.

The service also push the package of its helm chart on the Docker Registry, which can be directly used as Chart in ArgoCD Application to deploy the application on Minikube.

Additionally, within the Deployment folder, you will find an architecture diagram showcasing the CI/CD pipeline's structure.

## Tools and Technologies

- Java Spring Boot for building the microservice.

- Gradle for dependency management and builds.

- Helm as the package manager for Kubernetes.

- Prometheus & Grafana for monitoring and observability.

## Local Setup
Developers often prefer testing their applications on local clusters before deploying them to production.
This repository includes a local setup configuration. Navigate to the Deployment/local directory, where you'll find a .sh script to automate local deployment.

## Prerequisites
To successfully run the deployment script, ensure the following software is installed on your machine:
- Docker
- Minikube
- Helm
- ArgoCD 

The application will be deployed using Helm, with the Helm Package stored in the Docker Registry. Once deployed, the cluster and application will be monitored using Prometheus and Grafana, solving the observability challenge.

## Deployment
- Navigate to the Deployment/local directory.
- Execute the .sh script to automate the deployment locally:

```js
./run.sh
```

## Observability
The observability stack consists of:

- Prometheus: For metrics collection and alerting.

- Grafana: For building dashboards and visualizing metrics.

These tools provide insight into the cluster and application performance.
